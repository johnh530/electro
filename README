                              _


* Setup

    You might want to include the Electro binary directory in your path.
    Using bash, type the following, or add it to your .bashrc file.

        $ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/Electro/bin

    Or using tcsh, type the following, or add it to your .cshrc file.

        % setenv PATH ${PATH}:/usr/local/Electro/bin


* Running

    The run scripts take a list of Lua files as parameters.  Each file
    is executed in turn.

    To run Asteroids on nico:

        $ cd /usr/local/Electro/examples/asteroids
        $ electro-nico -f asteroids.lua

    Applications may be run in standalone mode in the same fashion:

        $ electro -f asteroids.lua


* Usage

    Activate the Electro application window by clicking in it.  It
    will grab the mouse pointer.  Press ESCAPE to release the pointer
    and pause the application.
