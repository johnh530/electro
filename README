* Running on PCs

    The run scripts take a list of Lua files as parameters.  Each file
    is executed in turn.  Here, the demo menu is used as an example:

    To run the demos under Linux or OS X:

        $ electro -f demo.lua

    To run the demos under Windows:

        C:\> electro.exe -f demo.lua

    Alternatively, drag and drop the demo.lua icon onto ELECTRO.BAT.


* Running on clusters

    Each cluster has an associated run script.  To run the demos on nico,
    make sure that "/DEMO/evl/Electro/bin" is included in your PATH,
    change to the Electro examples directory, and run it as follows:

        $ cd /DEMO/evl/Electro/examples
        $ electro-nico11x5 -f demo.lua

    On yorda:

        $ cd /DEMO/evl/Electro/examples
        $ electro-yorda11x5 -f demo.lua

    Vortex works best when Electro is allowed to capture the mouse pointer:

        $ electro-nico11x5 -m -f vortex.lua
    or
        $ electro-yorda11x5 -m -f vortex.lua
