* Setup

    You might want to include the Electro binary directory in your path.
    Using bash, type the following, or add it to your .bashrc file.

        $ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/Electro/bin

    Or using tcsh, type the following, or add it to your .cshrc file.

        % setenv PATH ${PATH}:/usr/local/Electro/bin


* Running

    The run scripts take a list of Lua files as parameters.  Each file is
    executed in turn.  Lua code should be careful to manage the location of
    any data files, but by default, application data is loaded from the
    current working directory.

    To run Asteroids on nico:

        $ cd /usr/local/Electro/examples/asteroids
        $ electro-nico asteroids.lua

    Applications may be run in standalone mode in the same fashion:

        $ electro asteroids.lua

    In addition the standalone mode may take a cluster configuration and
    will run locally in a simulator mode.  The cluster script should appear
    before the application script on the command line.

        $ electro /usr/local/electro/config/nico.lua asteroids.lua
