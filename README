* Running on PCs

    The run scripts take a list of Lua files as parameters.  Each file
    is executed in turn.  Here, Asteroids is used as an example

    To run the demos under Linux or OS X:

        $ ./electro -f examples/demo.lua

    To run the demos under Windows, drag and drop the demo.lua icon onto
    the electro.bat file, or type:

        C:\> electro.exe -f examples\demo.lua


* Running on clusters

    Each cluster has an associated run script.  To run the demos on nico,
    change to the Electro DEMO directory and run it as follows:

        $ cd /DEMO/evl/Electro
        $ bin/electro-nico11x5 -f examples/demo.lua

    On yorda:

        $ cd /DEMO/evl/Electro
        $ bin/electro-yorda11x5 -f examples/demo.lua

    Vortex works best when Electro is allowed to capture the mouse pointer:

        $ bin/electro-nico11x5 -m -f examples/vortex/vortex.lua
    or
        $ bin/electro-yorda11x5 -m -f examples/vortex/vortex.lua
