* Running

    The run scripts must know the location of the MPI machine files and Lua
    display configuration scripts. Set the ELECTRO_CONFIG environment variable
    to give their location.

    Using bash:

        $ export ELECTRO_CONFIG=$HOME/electro/data/config

    Or using tcsh:

        > setenv ELECTRO_CONFIG $HOME/electro/data/config

    The run scripts take a list of Lua files as parameters.  Each file is
    executed in turn.  Lua code should be careful to manage the location of
    any data files.  By default, application data is loaded from the current
    working directory.

        $ cd electro/data
        $ ../run_yorda view.lua
