* Running

    Set the ELECTRO_CONFIG environment variable to give the location
    of the MPI machinefiles and Lua display configuration scripts.

    Using bash:

        $ export ELECTRO_CONFIG=$HOME/electro/data/config

    Or using tcsh:

        > setenv ELECTRO_CONFIG $HOME/electro/data/config

    The run scripts take a list of Lua files as parameters.  Each file is
    executed in turn.  Lua code should be careful to manage the location of
    any data files.  By default, application data is loaded from the current
    working directory.

        $ cd electro/data
        $ ../run_yorda view.lua
