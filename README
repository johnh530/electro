* Running

    The run scripts must know the location of the MPI machine files and Lua
    display configuration scripts.  Confirm that the ELECTRO_CONFIG variable
    and ELECTRO_BIN variable specified in the script are correct.

    The run scripts take a list of Lua files as parameters.  Each file is
    executed in turn.  Lua code should be careful to manage the location of
    any data files.  By default, application data is loaded from the current
    working directory.

    To run Asteroids on nico:

        $ cd electro/examples/asteroids
        $ ../../electro-nico asteroids.lua

    Applications may be run in standalone mode in the same fashion:

        $ ../../electro asteroids.lua

    In addition the standalone mode may take a cluster configuration and
    will run locally in a simulator mode.  The cluster script should appear
    before the application script on the command line.

        $ ../../electro $ELECTRO_CONFIG/nico.lua asteroids.lua
