- demo.lua

    The Demo script displays a menu allows the various Electro examples to
    be launched interactively.

- data

    The data directory contains objects, textures, and materials used by
    multiple Electro apps.

- asteroids

    Asteroids is an example of a full-fledged game implemented in
    Electro using objects, textures, sounds, collision, and high
    scores storage.

    Press Space to start the game and fire the gun.  Arrows turn and
    boost the ship.  The joystick is also supported.

- driving

    The driving example uses the full rigid body dynamics system to
    define a drivable vehicle.

    The arrow keys and joystick control the car.  '1' spaws a box.
    '2' spawns a ball.  '3' spawns a car.  '4' flips the car onto its
    wheels in case it rolls onto its roof.

- fifteen

    The Fifteen Puzzle is the example described in the Electro tutorial
    documentation.  Arrow keys slide the tiles.

- viewobj

    ViewOBJ is a generic OBJ model viewer application.  ViewOBJ loads
    all OBJ files listed on the command line.

    Left-mouse-drag tumbles the object.  Right-mouse-drag scales the
    object.  The joystick and arrow keys navigate the virtual world.
    The insert and delete keys toggle object auto-spin.

- vortex

    Total Perspective Vortex demonstrates an interactive galaxy fly-through.

    Mouse motion pans the view.  Right-mouse-drag moves the view
    forward and back.  Middle-mouse-drag changes the star magnitude.
    Space bar halts the view motion and Return resets the view to the
    center.
