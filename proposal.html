<h1> Total Perspective Vortex </h1>

A visualization of the Milky Way galaxy for tiled displays.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h2> The Executive Summary </h2>

<h3> Motivation </h3>

<p> One of the more striking displays in the planetarium is the high
resolution panoramic image of the Milky Way galaxy.  It is beautiful,
and informative, but static.  The message it conveys could benefit
significantly from the more dynamic interactivity that a high
resolution tiled display would allow.  So, I propose the
implementation of an interactive application, based upon and
augmenting the galaxy exhibit, for the use on a tiled display.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3> Features </h3>

<p> The galaxy display has several features which must be preserved
by an interactive implementation:

<ol>
<li> On the map below the image it indicates where a number of
astronomical objects are to be found in the sky.

<li> On the monitors above the image it conveys the apparent sizes of
these objects by zooming in from an unmagnified view.

<li> On the galaxy map to the side it shows where these objects are to
be found in the galaxy, where the Earth is located, and how objects
are positioned relative to Earth.

</ol>

<p> A high-resolution interactive display can include each of these
features, in a similar form.

<ol>
<li> Astronomical objects may be highlighted by markers overlaid on
the image.  The viewer may use a pointing device to select objects for
more information to be overlaid on the display.  These objects may
include stars, constellations, and items too distant to be seen at
normal magnification.

<li> The viewer may select a distant objects for closer scrutiny
and see the entire display zoom in toward it.

<li> Having selected an object, the viewer may move the viewpoint
outside of the galaxy, causing the viewpoint to transition smoothly to
a distance from which the entirety of the galaxy may be seen, with the
selected object and the Earth both highlighted.

</ol>

<p> A few further  enhancements to these features are possible:

<ol>
<li> A potentially large number of objects of interest may be defined
if a mechanism is implemented to make their marker overlays adaptively
visible.  These markers may be hidden while ignored, so that they do
not obstruct the view, and become visible only when the pointer nears
them.  More interesting objects may be highlighted more persistently.

<li> The viewer may interactively control the level of magnification,
and may even be allowed to zoom on arbitrary portions of the screen.

<li> If the user is allowed some control over the scope of the galaxy
view, a number of interesting sights become available.  For example, a
viewer may select a constellation and see lines drawn between stars.
Moving away from the Earth, he may see the true 3D shape of this
constellation, and so gain some idea of the 3D structure of the night
sky.

</ol>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h2> A Few Notable Details </h2>

<h3> Demonstration </h3>

<p> When the display detects that it has not been used for a brief
period, it transitions into attract mode.  In this mode it moves from
one object to the next, selecting, pausing, zooming in, and zooming
out, as appropriate for each.  When a user touches the controls, it
immediately transitions back to the Earth-centered view, at normal
magnification.  Object selection in attract mode may be random or
scripted.

<p> This behavior has the dual purpose of displaying the capabilities
of the application, as well as providing interesting viewing for
patrons interested only in a passive experience.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3> Interface </h3>

<p> The proposed interface includes a single trackball and 3 &plusmn;
1 buttons, depending on the desired options.

<ul>
<li> The trackball rotates the view left/right and up/down.  Any
object near the center of the display, falling within a selection
indicater, is being "referred-to" or "moused-over".  (It can be argued
that a static view direction with a mouse-like pointer is more
appropriate.  In the opinion of this author, such an interface makes
usage difficult at the far sides of the display, and causes objects
such as Polaris and Alpha Centauri to be unviewable.)

<li> An "Info" button selects the referred-to object and displays an
information overlay.

<li> Two potential interfaces for zoom control are proposed, one simple
but limited, and the other more complex but more powerful:

<ul>
<li> The simple view defines "Zoom In" and "Zoom Out" buttons.  These
trigger smooth transitions between 3 defined views of the selected
object: magnified, normal, and galactic.

<li> The more complex view defines only a single "Zoom" control that
enables zoom level using the trackball.  Motion upward zooms in, and
outward zooms out.  When zoomed in past normal, a magnified view is
shown.  When zoomed out past normal, a galactic view is shown.  When
released, the zoom level remains the same, allowing the viewer to pan
about a magnified sky, or to tumble the galaxy view.

</ul>

<li> A further optional feature might provide a "Goto" button.  This
would trigger a transition of the viewpoint from Earth to the selected
object.  Such a feature would allow the night sky to be viewed from
another star.  A "Home" button or persistent Earth overlay marker
would be necessary to reset the view.

</ul>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3> Implementation </h3>

<p> The implementation of this proposed display consists of four
distinct types of data, rendered together to a single image using
OpenGL.

<ol>
<li> Local stars are taken from the Hipparcos catalog.  This
represents over 100,000 stars with parallax measurements sufficient to
determine position.  They are rendered with correct apparent magnitude
from any point in space.

<li> Constellations are defined as sets of edges, where each edge
connects two stars.  This author is not aware of any available
constellation definition dataset compatible with the Hipparcos
catalog, but as there are only 88 constellations, they would not be
difficult to define by hand.

<li> Notable nebulae are displayed as images.  While these images only
appear correct from a viewpoint centered at Earth, this should not be
an issue.  They are generally very small when viewed from Earth, and
zooming in (telescopic view) is mutually exclusive from zooming out
(galactic view, where alternate views of distant objects would become
possible).

<li> The Milky Way itself is displayed as a volumetric model of a
spiral galaxy, rendered with an adaptive level of detail.  Not enough
is known of the structure of the galaxy for an accurate depiction, so
some artistic liberty is taken.  One significant constraint here is
that the volume of the galaxy appear to integrate smoothly with the
local star catalog during a zoom-out transition.
