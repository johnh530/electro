11x5.lua

    This script configures all 55 LambdaVision tiles using 1600x1200
    windows across the 29 hosts of nico and yorda.  It is referenced
    by both the nico11x5 and yorda11x5 startup scripts, allowing
    either the nico or yorda master to act as server.

cube.lua

    This script opens a single 1600x1200 window with 6 square
    viewports.  The 6 views look down the 6 axes, and together the 6
    view frustums fill the unit cube.  Using this configuration, a
    cube map of any scene may be generated simply by taking a
    screenshot.

geowall-quad-stereo.lua

    This script configures a GeoWall using dual 1280x1024 displays in
    quad-buffered stereo clone mode.

geowall-side-by-side.lua

    This script configures a GeoWall using dual 1280x1024 displays in
    horizontal span mode.

idesk4.lua

    This script configures the IDesk4 using dual 2560x1600 displays in
    vertical span mode.

planar-side-by-side.lua

    This script configures the Planar display using dual 1280x1024
    displays in horizontal span mode.

quad-stereo.lua

    This script configures a default 800x600 window with quad-buffered
    stereo enabled.  This appropriate for use with CrystalEyes stereo
    glasses.

scylla.lua

    This script configures the 35 tiles of the full Varrier using
    1600x1200 windows across the 19 hosts of scylla.  It also defines
    a set of keyboard commands that can be used to configure and tweak
    the Varrier line screen calibration and Varrier rendering mode.
    This script should be run with TRACKD enabled, as the view frustum
    is centered at head-height, not at the origin.

table.lua

    This script configures the 15 tiles of the LambdaTable using
    1280x1024 windows across 10 nodes of yorda.  (This script is
    obsolete, as yorda no longer drives the table.  It is merely a
    reference to be applied to the next LambdaTable configuration.)

test.lua

    This script configures 4 small tiles in a single 800x600 window.
    This is usefull for local viewport and view-culling testing.
