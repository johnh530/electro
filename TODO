frustum structure

flicker?
regenerate galaxy files

analyze performance
    find the bottleneck on nico
        free-run on null scene
        free-run on zero magnitude
    free-run may be ok since MPI restructuring

css print
fp/vp per entity (also fixes standard string length)
Scale and billboard frustum (thorough test)

TTF support (distribute the ttf?  Just the image?)
asteroids text overlay models?

camera near/far (automatic? (entity bounding sphere?))

Reorganize MPI abstraction (it's simpler than it once was)
Improve assertions (delineate necessary thing_exists vs thing_assert)

Particle system? (stars?)

frustum transform = matrix multiplication?
        identity matrix is idempotent frustum?
