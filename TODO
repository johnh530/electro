console
directory fixes (can't use manual CWD because of lua state)
    on script load, chdir path, dofile filename
    (thus LAST script will set cwd)
    (don't forget PWD env)

arguments to lua script?
fp/vp per entity (also fixes standard string length)

Scale and billboard frustum (thorough test)

TTF support (distribute the ttf?  Just the image?)
Star VBO?  (Ok if tree is NOT pruned)
asteroids text overlay models?

camera near/far (automatic? (entity bounding sphere?))

Reorganize MPI abstraction (it's simpler than it once was)
Improve assertions (delineate necessary thing_exists vs thing_assert)
Improve linear descriptor seaching (next-free list) (growable buffer?)
Improve clone reference counting

Particle system? (stars?)

frustum transform = matrix multiplication?
        identity matrix is idempotent frustum?
